Documentation for me developing this project!

## Code Journal 1 - May 25, 2023

This project is being developed with interoperability and learning the building blocks in mind. I also need to make sure that feature creep does not cause me to be distracted so often that I don't actually deploy any NFTs (as is typical with me).

The first thing I need to do is limit the first collection in size and scope. The first collection will be named something like "Winter Attack Genesis" and will be a small / limited collection of 10-25 pieces of AI generated art post processed and placed in custom built frames in Blender, saved as Blender assets.

**Let's break down what needs to be done:**

[x] Generate the images - I've completed this, 10 images
[ ] Post process the images so they all have similar filters and coloring.
[ ] Design the Metadata for the images, this will include the MidJourney prompt.
[ ] Model picture frames in blender using this tutorial: Creating Photo Frame Assets in Blender, Johnny Matthews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apz-ioWfV_U&t=49s
[ ] Launch collection on testnet
[ ] Launch collection on mainnet

I have a lot of work to do all of this. But, once I've done it once it will go a lot more smoothly for the next collections. I'll probably launch a bunch of winter attack collections, and then get to work on the custom smart contract called "The Splitter Contract" that I will use to link the collections up.

The general idea behind this collection and other collections using the splitter contract is that if you hold an NFT in any of the collections that are linked up via the splitter contract, you receive a percentage of future minting proceeds from any other collection that is connected to the collection you minted via splitter. All of the flow of proceeds will be programmatic. The parameters (such as what % of the minting and trading commissions flow to holders of NFTs in which collection) will eventually be only adjustable by on-chain governance.

The primary goal is to use these collections as a development playground to beta test some of my ideas regarding decentralization and interconnectivity as well as to begin the process of community building, with the ultimate goal that all roads lead to the Flarnchain blockchain, and bringing the worlds inside my head to life and "onchain" as they say. I recently read an article about the concept of "onchain" which I'll have to drum up and post here later.

That's it for tonight on the developer log. I was supposed to be writing my newsletter tonight, but I got distracted by this project. I'm going to copy and paste most of this log in my newsletter as a way to fill it out and go to bed at a reasonable time.
