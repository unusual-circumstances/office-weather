# Office Weather
A series of NFTs showcasing whimsical and creative depictions of weather conditions in different office environments throughout the ages.

The Office Weather collection is a series of NFTs showcasing whimsical and creative depictions of weather conditions in different office environments throughout the ages. Each piece is part of a limited series, ultimately connecting to the larger "Unusual Circumstances" meta collection via The Splitter smart contract.

There will be multiple limited series deployed in the Office Weather collection, all connected via splitter contracts.

## Roadmap

*Collections*

1. Winter Attack - the genesis collection
2. Spring Deluge - 
3. Collection 3

*Tasks*

1. Generate the base art using MidJourney prompts. Document the actual prompt in the Metadata.
2. Map out the metadata traits for images in the office weather collection.
3. Model a whole bunch of picture frames in blender with custom materials.
4. Use Krita, Gimp or other free illustration / photo editing software to color correct and add custom filters and film grain to the base art.
5. Combine picture frames with images, turn into Blender assets that are unlockable to owners of each individual nft. This will let the owner use the art as a custom picture asset that can be used in Blender scenes and other digital landscapes.

Step 5 is crucial, as it makes these NFTs useful for 3d modellers who want to add a bit of flair to their scenes. Perhaps a scene with a couple of these pictures in the background could add some extra flair. Likewise, developing a strong asset pipeline will go a long way in building the skills necessary to work through all of the complexities associated with creating a digital world.
